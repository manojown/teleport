## 2.5.1

This release of Teleport fixes a regression in Teleport binaries.

#### Bug Fixes

* Binaries for macOS have been rebuilt to resolve "certificate signed by a unknown authority" issue.

## 2.5.0

This is a major release of Teleport. Its goal is to make cloud-native
deployments easier. Numerous AWS users have contributed feedback to this
release, which includes:

#### New Features

* Auth servers in highly available (HA) configuration can share the same `/var/lib/teleport`
  data directory when it's hosted on NFS (or AWS EFS).
  [#1351](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1351)

* There is now an AWS reference deployment in `examples/aws` directory.  It
  uses Terraform and demonstrates how to deploy large Teleport clusters on AWS
  using best practices like auto-scaling groups, security groups, secrets
  management, load balancers, etc.

* The Teleport daemon now implements built-in connection draining which allows
  zero-downtime upgrades.
  [See documentation](https://gravitational.com/teleport/docs/admin-guide/#graceful-restarts).

* Dynamic join tokens for new nodes can now be explicitly set via `tctl node add --token`.
  This allows Teleport admins to use an external mechanism for generating
  cluster invitation tokens.
  [#1615](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/1615)

* Teleport now correctly manages certificates for accessing proxies behind a
  load balancer with the same domain name. The new configuration parameter
  `public_addr` must be used for this.
  [#1174](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1174).

#### Improvements

* Switching to a new TLS-based auth server API improves performance of large clusters.
  [#1528](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1528)

* Session recordings are now compressed by default using gzip. This reduces storage
  requirements by up to 80% in our real-world tests.
  [#1579](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1528)

* More user-friendly authentication errors in Teleport audit log helps Teleport admins
  troubleshoot configuration errors when integrating with SAML/OIDC providers.
  [#1554](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1554),
  [#1553](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1553),
  [#1599](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1599)

* `tsh` client will now report if a server's API is no longer compatible.

#### Bug Fixes

* `tsh logout` will now correctly log out from all active Teleport sessions. This is useful
  for users who're connected to multiple Teleport clusters at the same time.
  [#1541](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1541)

* When parsing YAML, Teleport now supports `--` list item separator to create
  multiple resources with a single `tctl create` command.
  [#1663](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1663)

* Fixed a panic in the Web UI backend [#1558](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1558)

#### Behavior Changes

Certain components of Teleport behave differently in version 2.5. It is important to
note that these changes are not breaking Teleport functionality. They improve
Teleport behavior on large clusters deployed on highly dynamic cloud
environments such as AWS. This includes:

* Session list in the Web UI is now limited to 1,000 sessions.
* The audit log and recorded session storage has been moved from `/var/lib/teleport/log`
  to `/var/lib/teleport/log/<auth-server-id>`. This is related to [#1351](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1351)
  described above.
* When connecting a trusted cluster users can no longer pick an arbitrary name for them.
  Their own (local) names will be used, i.e. the `cluster_name` setting now defines how
  the cluster is seen from the outside.
  [#1543](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1543)

#### New Features

* New Commercial Teleport Editions: "Pro" and "Business" allow users to
  purchase a Teleport subscription without signing contracts.
* Teleport now supports SSH session recording even for nodes running OpenSSH [#1327](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1327)
  This feature is called "recording proxy mode".
* Users of open source edition of Teleport can now authenticate against Github [#1445](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1445)

  using build-in SSH agents for MacOS and Linux, like `ssh-agent` from
  `openssh-client` package.

notable fixed bugs are listed below:

* Resource (file descriptor) leak [#1433](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/1433)

## 2.0.6

### Bugfixes

* Fixed regression in TLP-01-009.

## 2.0.5

Teleport 2.0.5 contains a variety of security fixes. We strongly encourage anyone running Teleport 2.0.0 and above to upgrade to 2.0.5.

The most pressing issues (a phishing attack which can potentially be used to extract plaintext credentials and an attack where an already authenticated user can escalate privileges) can be resolved by upgrading the web proxy. However, however all nodes need to be upgraded to mitigate all vulnerabilities. 

### Bugfixes

* Patch for TLP-01-001 and TLP-01-003: Check redirect.
* Patch for TLP-01-004: Always check is namespace is valid.
* Patch for TLP-01-005: Check user principal when joining session.
* Patch for TLP-01-006 and TLP-01-007: Validate Session ID.
* Patch for TLP-01-008: Use a fake hash for password authentication if user does not exist.
* Patch for TLP-01-009: Command injection in scp.

## 2.0.4

### Bugfixes

* Roles created the the Web UI now have `node` resource. [#949](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/949)

## 2.0.3

### Bugfixes

* Execute commands using user's shell.  [#943](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/943)
* Allow users to read their own roles. [#941](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/941)
* Fix User CA import. [#919](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/919)
* Role template defaults. [#916](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/916)
* Skip UserInfo if not provided. [#915](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/pull/915)
